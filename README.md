# IT Chat Support Bot

## Introduction

The IT Chat Support Bot is a UI which interfaces with IBM Watson for technical support help. The idea is that a user will first interace with the Watson Support Bot before moving on to a IT Support Staff Agent. The customer can interact with the IT Support Staff agent through the same GUI when the user tells the Bot they want to speak with a human. From there, the customer and the IT Support Staff agent will be able to conversate.
